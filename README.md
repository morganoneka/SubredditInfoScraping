# SubredditInfoScraping

I was looking through a dataset on Kaggle and thought "hmm, it would be useful if there was a dataset that provided some level of categorization for the subreddits on Reddit". I couldn't find such a dataset, so I made one myself! In this project, I scrape subreddit information from [FindAReddit](https://www.findareddit.com/) using BeautifulSoup. The final dataset is available for use on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/morganoneka/subreddit-categorization).
